# ammarhany.com â€“ Personal Portfolio

This is the source code for [ammarhany.com](https://ammarhany.com), the personal portfolio website of Ammar Hany. Built with Next.js and TypeScript, this project showcases professional experience, skills, and creative work in a modern, fast, and responsive web application.

## About

The portfolio is designed to present:

- **CV/Resume**: Education, work history, skills, and achievements.
- **Portfolio**: Projects, case studies, and creative work.
- **Contact**: Easy ways to get in touch, including a contact form and social links.

The site is built with Next.js for server-side rendering and fast performance, and TypeScript for type safety and maintainability. The design is clean, professional, and focused on accessibility and user experience.
